TODO:
	* REQ - add up totalcosts by county, use proj total to calc avg
	* REQ - shade areas by average project cost in that county 
	* change built-in PHP server to Node.js standalone server
	* sort project types alphabetically -- either in stats obj or w/ special func
	add promises to rendering functions, so it's easier to handle when they're done
	hide various configs on server side
	decompose code into proper Angular factories, directives, components etc
	add mediaqueries for mobile?
	normalize some data into other JSON files, split from full JSON file
	Add build process via webpack
	Include lodash/underscore, (replace indexOf with contains, etc)
	sort NGProgram list by text

WOULD BE NICE:
	icons for different proj types
	display legend for cholorpleth(s) at left
