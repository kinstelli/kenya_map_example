TODO:
	* fix spinner overlay to be asynch'd against render functions
	only allow unique text in ng programme filter
	decompose code into proper Angular factories, directives, components etc
	Add build process via gulp/webpack
	add promises to rendering functions, so it's easier to handle when they're done
	hide various configs on server side
	add mediaqueries for mobile?
	normalize some data into other JSON files, split from full JSON file
	Include lodash/underscore, (replace indexOf with contains, etc)
	Add better alternative to the ugly multi-select box

WOULD BE NICE:
	icons for different proj types
	display legend for cholorpleth(s) at left
