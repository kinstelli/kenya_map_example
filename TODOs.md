##### TODOs:

- Fix spinner overlay -- not properly async'd prior to render functions
- Related: add promises to rendering functions, so it's easier to handle when they're done
- Decompose code into proper Angular factories, directives, components etc
- Add build process via gulp/webpack
- Hide various configs on server side
- Add mediaqueries for mobile/responsive design
- Normalize some data into other JSON files, split from full JSON file
- Include lodash/underscore, (replace indexOf with contains, etc)
- Add alternative to the ugly multi-select box
- Consider changing the clustering settings to optimize between visual clarity (some clusters are far from their counties) and load times

##### WOULD BE NICE:
- Create icons for different proj types
- Display dynamic legend for cholorpleth(s) colors at left
